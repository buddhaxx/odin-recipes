    <p>It is of my utmost (and unimportant) opinion that not much comes close to beating a well-made sloppy joe Sandwich
        for a pleasant and filling lunch. With all of the robust notes from the sauce smothering the hearty beef filling,
        a nice sloppy joe covers almost all of the bases. Without further ado, let's get this rolling!
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    </p>
    <p>As usual, we will start with an ingredients list as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 small green bell pepper, seeded and finely diced</li>
            <li>1 tbsp worchestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp yellow mustard</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>15 oz can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 lb lean ground beef, 85%-90% lean</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>

            <li>4 hamburger buns, toasted if desired</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Now that we've got that all covered, let's put it all together!</p>
