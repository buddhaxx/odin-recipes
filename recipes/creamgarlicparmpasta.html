    </p>
    <p>To start this wonderful treat, first we need to gather
        ingredients! Here is a list of what we need:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup parmesan cheese, finely grated</li>
            <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>4 cloves fresh garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>8 oz. angel hair pasta</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley to garnish</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Now that we've got that all covered, let's put it all together!</p>
    <p><h3>Directions</h3></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt 2 tbsp of butter over medium heat in a large skillet.</li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth. Slowly add the milk, stirring as you do so.
                <strong>Bring to a boil.</strong></li>
            <li>Add the pasta noodles. You can break in half or let them heat until soft.</li>
            <li>Let the pasta simmer for 4-5- minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure
                the noodles don't stick together. <strong>Reduce heat to low.</strong></li>
            <li>Add 1 tablespoon of butter to warm pasta and toss to coat.</li>
            <li>Gradually sprinkle in parmesan as you're stirring until it is smooth and combined.
                <b>Note:</b> The sauce will be thin at first, but it will thicken upon standing.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with fresh parsley and serve!</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

        For even more awesome flavor, be sure to serve with a tasteful serving of garlic bread with cheese!
